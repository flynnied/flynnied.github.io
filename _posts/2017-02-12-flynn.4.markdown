My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until....."We've got a Burn Notice on you your blacklisted. (Whistles). When your burned you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history. Your stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. "Where am I?"..."Miami". You do whatever work comes your way.
You relie on anyone who's still talking to you. (Laughs). A trigger happy ex-girlfriend. "Should we shoot them?"
An old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I. "You know spy's bunch of bitchy little girls.
Family too. "Hey is that your mom again?" If your desperate.  "Someone needs your help Michael?" And a down and out spy you met along the way. "That how we do it people".
Bottom line as long as your burned your not going anywhere.

Burn Notice is without a doubt one of my favorite shows. Alot like MacGyver Michael Westen, the main character, tries not to shoot anyone. 
Not only is it action packed, but it is also pretty funny to watch the bad guys get <span class="mclWstn">REKT</span>.
