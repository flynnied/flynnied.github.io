CS:GO is a super terrific game made by Valve(the creators of Steam).

CS:GO is a First-Person-Shooter/Strategy game created in 2012. However, I bought it in 2015. When I first bought the game I was not aware that you cannot aim down the sight of your gun unless it has a scope. 
I thought that was super stupid because I was coming from COD. If I knew this before I bought the game, I probably would not have bought it. But, I'm glad I bought it. If I never actually played the game I would have missed out on so much.

CS:GO has many professional teams. Each year there are a few tournaments so the best teams have a chance to win 1st place. This year there has only been one tournament. It was in Atlanta. However, there will be more.

If you are interested in buying this game at just 14.99 please [Click Here] [Here]. I highly recomend this game.
